[//]: # (Due to the rapid development of the quadruped robot industry in the past decade, various commercial quadruped robots )

[//]: # (adaptive module, which considers the temporal robot states. This module empowers the control policy to implicitly online )

[//]: # (identify different robot platforms' properties and estimate body velocity. Extensive experiments in the real world and )

[//]: # (simulation demonstrate that our controller enables robots with significantly different morphology to overcome various )

[//]: # (indoor and outdoor harsh terrains.)
